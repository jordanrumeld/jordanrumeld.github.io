The most common question I have been asked since begining my journey into programming is simply, Why?

I have always been very interested in technology and while I wouldnt necessarily call myself a "techy" (or at least yet), I am amazed everyday by how much a role it has on our everyday lives. My eyes were really opened up when the age of applications came around and now exists on almost everyone of our phones. I finally have the time I need to take this course and turn my love and hobby of programming into a career.
